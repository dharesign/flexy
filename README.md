# Flexy â€” a flexbox-based grid system

Flexy is a flexbox-based grid system. I wrote it after failing to find an
existing solution which exactly matched my requirements. I wanted something
very minimal (just a grid system), with no vendor-specific prefix as I deem
them [no longer necessary][1]. I also wanted sizes to be specified in `rem`
units.

For examples, [see the demo][2].
